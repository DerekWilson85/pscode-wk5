// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

(Obtain 2 number from input source
Number 1 will be called Num1
Number 2 will be called Num2
Fetch Num1 and add it to Num2 for a sum of those two Numbers
Print the sum of those two numbers on the screen)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Obtain a number from an input source
Fetch Number that was obtained from input source.
Check if number is divisible evenly by 2 if yes print Even
if no print odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Obtain 4 separate numbers from source input
The first number provided will be Num1
The second number provided will be Num2
The third number provided will be Num3
The fourth number provided will be Num4
The fifth number provided will be Num5
Fetch Num1, Num2, Num3, Num4 and Num5 and then add them together and divide the total by the number 5 to determine the average of the five numbers
Store this in DB1 as Average

Fetch Num1, Num2, Num3, Num4 and Num5 and then determine which of the five is the largest and which of the five is the smallest total
Store the largest in DB1 as Maximum and Store the smallest in DB1 as Minimum

Fetch Average in DB1 and print on screen labeled as Average - This is the average of the 5 separate nubmers that were input by the source
Fetch Maximum in DB1 and print on screen labeled as Maximum - This is the largest number that was input by the source
Fetch Minimum in DB1 and print on screen labeled as Minimum - This is the smallest number that was input by the source)
